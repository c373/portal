I am at my best solving challenging problems where I have a high degree of 
creative control. In Software Development I found a happy medium, and so I 
decided to pursue a career in tech. I graduated March 24th, 2023 from the 
Application Development track of Year Up and during the final stretch of the 
program I interned at Expeditors. While there I helped develop internal web and
java gui applications, eventually I was extended an offer and have joined a
systems team where I am focusing on automating CI/CD pipelines and developing
tools and assisting in building out infrastructure.
